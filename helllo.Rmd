code & output is being printed

```{r}
a = 2
b = 3
d = a ^ b
print(d)
```

output only printed

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
a = 2
b = 3
d = a ^ b
print(d)
for (i in 1:100){d = d + i}
print(d)
```

code only printed

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a = 2
b = 3
d = a ^ b
print(d)
```


echo (means code is displayed) and eval (means code is evaluated) are true by default.

how to put in a picture

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center', echo = F}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("pikachu.png")
```

to use a picture in a different folder, type in whole path

# writing equations

separate line:

$$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$$

in a line:

hello this line has an equation $\bar x = \frac{1}{n} \sum X_i$
 




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
